# cricket-data-analysis

This project involves the analysis of cricket data from One Day Internationals (ODI) sourced from a publicly available dataset. The dataset contains detailed statistics for 2,693 players, with 25 columns, capturing a range of performance metrics such as runs scored, strike rates, bowling figures, and dismissals. The analysis focuses on uncovering insights and testing specific hypotheses related to player performance.

The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for this project uses Plotly for some visualizations so you need to run this on your local machine to generate the visualizations.
